# [Sonarr](https://sonarr.tv/)

> Sonarr is a PVR for Usenet and BitTorrent users. It can monitor multiple RSS feeds for new episodes of your favorite shows and will grab, sort and rename them. It can also be configured to automatically upgrade the quality of files already downloaded when a better quality format becomes available. 

## Overview

This will use the official setup script to install _nzbget_ and add 2 mount points: 

- config
- library
- transfer

## Usage

Edit the `setup.sh` script to match your requirements ( the file is heavily commented ), then run:

`./setup.sh`
