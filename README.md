# IOcage Plugin Scripts

> These are not supposed to be used without customisation. Please don't use blindly

## Overview

A set of scripts to ease creation of jails so I can quickly upgrade other people's systems.

These were shamelessly taken and adapted from [FN11.2 iocage jails - Plex, Tautulli, Sonarr, Radarr, Lidarr, Jackett, Transmission, Organizr](https://forums.freenas.org/index.php?resources/fn11-2-iocage-jails-plex-tautulli-sonarr-radarr-lidarr-jackett-transmission-organizr.58/) and this [gist](https://gist.github.com/mow4cash/e2fd4991bd2b787ca407a355d134b0ff), but all that copying and pasting got to me.
